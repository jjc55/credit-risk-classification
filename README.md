# Module 20 Challenge Supervised Machine Learning

In this challenge, I used a dataset on historical lending activity to build a model that can evaluate creditworthiness of individuals interested in borrowing money from a peer-to-peer lending company. I used supervised machine learning techniques that I learned during the course to build out the model. First, I started by splitting the dataset into a training and testing set. The training set will be used to develop the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate the performance of the model.
